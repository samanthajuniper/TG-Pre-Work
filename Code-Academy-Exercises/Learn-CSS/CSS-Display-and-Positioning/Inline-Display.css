<h1><strong>Welcome</strong> to our survey!</h1>



<!--The display property determines if an HTML element can share horizontal space with other elements. The display property allows you to apply inline styling to specifc parts of a whole element. On line 1, I used the inline tags <strong></strong> to make the word "welcome" larger. This allowed the word "welcome" to remain part of the <h1> element without moving it to another line or altering the display of the other text within the tag. In line elements take up the least amoun to fspace possible, and their width and height cannot be changed. -->
