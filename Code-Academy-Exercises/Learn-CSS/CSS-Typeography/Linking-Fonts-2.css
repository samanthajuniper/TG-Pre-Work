/*I learned how to link to a google font on my html sheet. Within the self-closing link tag I added the font URL and set it equal to the sum of the two fonts I wanted. Then I added a colon to specify the font weights I wanted as well. I also specified that the link was related to the stylesheet. On my stylesheet I applied the Space Mono font to the element with the fallback font of monospace.*/
