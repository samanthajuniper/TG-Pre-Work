/*The @font-face property imports fonts directly to a stylesheet. You enter in the font's URL link (previously copied from https://fonts.google.com ) and enter it into the browser. THe browser then loads the CSS rules, and you can copy and paste the rules between the labels that read "latin" with the @font-face property to the top of your own style sheet. */
