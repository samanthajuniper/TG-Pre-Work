/* By default, the height and width of an HTML box are set to hold the raw contents of the box. Height and width properties take numerical values in the form of pixels, which allow the dimensions to be the same size on all devices. On line 7 I made the height of the element with the banner id 700 pixels. On line 12 I made the width element with the class pull-quote 350 pixels. And on line 21 I made the width of the elements with the id banner, the class content, and h1 tags 400 pixels. */
