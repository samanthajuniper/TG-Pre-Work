<!--The hyperlink above takes the user to a visual representation of the box model. The inner most part of the box is the content area, which the height and width properties directly apply to. The space surrounding the content area is the padding, which lies between the content area and the border. The border surrounds the content area and the padding--the thickness and style (i.e. color) of the border can be changed. The margin is the remaining space between the border and the outside edge of the element. -->
