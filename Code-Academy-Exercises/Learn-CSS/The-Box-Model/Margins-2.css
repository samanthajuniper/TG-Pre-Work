/* On line 9 I learned how to use a shortcut for margins: 30px is the amount of padding for the top and bottom sides, while 20px is the amount of padding for the left and right sides. I could also make the margin size different on each side in a single line of code by listing the four margin values in a clockwise order (top, right, bottom, left).*/
