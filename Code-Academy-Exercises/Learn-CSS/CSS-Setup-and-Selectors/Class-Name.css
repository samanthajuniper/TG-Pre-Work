/* HTMl elements can be given class names, which can then be referenced on a CSS styling sheet. On the HTML page, there is an element with the class name of "title". In the CSS sheet, I selected that class name on line 14 by putting a period in front of the class name. Anything on the HTML page that has the "title" class will now be teal. */
