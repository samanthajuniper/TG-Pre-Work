/* I tried to match up the styling elements with the HTML elements when I looked through the article on soccer. The CSS sheet is separate from the HTML sheet. There are no inline styling elements. THe styling on the CSS sheet is applied to the content on the HTMl sheet, and as a result we get to see the outcome of both on the right panel (i.e. the background color, the font color, the heading, paragraphs, etc.).  */
