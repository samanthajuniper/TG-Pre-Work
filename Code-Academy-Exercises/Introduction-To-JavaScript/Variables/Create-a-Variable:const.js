/* The key word "const", short for constant, can also be used to declare a variable. A "const" variable can't be reassigned because it is constant. On line 1 I decalred a constant variable named "entree" and assigned it the value "Enchiladas". When I tried to reassign this varibale on line 5, I recieved the following message in the console : "TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.". This happened because you can't reassign a constant variable. A constant variable also cannot be declared without assigning it a value, so the undefined variable on line 7 reported the following error: "SyntaxError: Missing initializer in const declaration". */
