/* On line one I used the keyword var, short for variable, to declare the variable "favoriteFood". I then assigned the value "pizza" to the variable "favoriteFood". On line 3 I called the variable to print its contents in the console, and "pizza" was printed. The best practice for naming variables is in camel casing, which makes the first word lowercase and everyword after that has its first letter capitalized. Variables cannot be named as keywords or begin with a number. */
