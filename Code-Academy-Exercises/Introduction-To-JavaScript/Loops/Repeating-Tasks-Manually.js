// Write your code below

let vacationSpots = ['Switzerland', 'Iceland', 'Hot Springs'];

console.log(vacationSpots[0]);
console.log(vacationSpots[1]);
console.log(vacationSpots[2]);

/*In this example, each element of the "vacationSpots" array needs its own line of code if we want to log them separately to the console. This is an inefficent and tedious method that could be streamlined using For Loops. */
