/* For Loop syntax is as follows: for (iterator variable/initialization; stopping condition; iteration statement) {code block that will execute until the condition evaluates to false}. On line 2 I created a for loop that has the following components: the initalization says to start counting at the number 5; the loop is to stop counting once it reaches the number 10; each iteration of the loop will add 1 to the number it's counting. */
