/*The most condensed form of the function is known as concise body. Since the function only had one parameter, I removed the parentheses. Since the code is only on a single line, the curly braces can also be deleted. The contents of the function to be executed immediately follow the fat arrow.  The "return" word was deleted because there is an implict return noted by the single line of code. Lastly, the ternary operator "?" was used to replace the if else statement so the code could all fit on one line. */
