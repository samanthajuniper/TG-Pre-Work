/* A function declaration binds a name to a function. On lines 1-3 I used the "function" key word to declare a funtion named "getReminder". This function will print "Water the plants" to the console when called. It is important to know that JavaScript allows access to function declarations even if they are undefined--this is called hoisting and it is considered bad practice. */
