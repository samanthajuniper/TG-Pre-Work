/* Each element in an array has a numbered position called an index, which can be used to access an individual element within an array. Elements in an array  are zero-indexed, which means the first count starts at zero instead of 1. On line 3 I created a variable "listItem" and assigned it the first value of the "famousSayings" array on line 1. On line 7 I logged the third element of the "famousSayings" array by using the element's index number, 2.*/
