/*A nested array is an array that contains another array (like an array-ception). On line 1 I created a nested array that holds three elements, each with two values inside them. On line 3 I created a constant variable and assigned it a value from the "numberCluster" array using the following syntax: I first referenced the array "numberCluster; then I told it to choose the second element in that array using "[2]", which looks at the "[5,6] element; finally I instructed the computer to use the second value in that array element using [1]. As a result the variable target was assigned a value of 6 (see line 5). */
