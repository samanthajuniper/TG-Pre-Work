/*Curly braces, {}, are used to designate an object literal. An object is filled with key-value pairs. A key is like a variable name that points to a location in memory that holds a value, and its value can be of any data type in the language including functions or other objects. The object literal "spaceship" on line 2 has two properties: "fuel type: turbo fuel" and "color: silver". The first strings before the colons are the keys, and the strings after the colons are values. */
