/* Because key-pairs within objects are not indexed, we have to use "for...in" syntax to loop through objects. On lines 27-29 I created a "for...in" statement that iterates through the "spaceship" object and logs the role and name of each crew member. This is done by telling the program to look for the names of the specific nested key pairs for role and name and only printing those to the console. */
