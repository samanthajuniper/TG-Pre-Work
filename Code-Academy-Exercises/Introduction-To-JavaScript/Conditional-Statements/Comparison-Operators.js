/*Comparison operators can be used to compare two values against each other. On line 3 the comparison operator ">" is used to determine if the value of the "hungerLevel" variable is greater than 7. The if statement on line 3-7 then evaluates as follows: if "hungerLevel" is greater than 7 print "Time to eat!" to the console, and if "hungerLevel" is not greater than 7, print "We can eat later!" to the console. Since 7 is not greater than 7, the else string was printed to the console. */
