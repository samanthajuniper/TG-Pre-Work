/* An if statement is a conditional that tells the computer to execute a certain task if the conditions are met. On line 1 I created the "sale" variable and set it equal to the boolean value of "true". On lines 5 through 8 the if statement evaluates whether or not the variable "sale" has a value of "true". If "sale" does have a value of "true" the string "Time to buy!" will print to the console. If that condition is not present, then no code will run. In this case, the "sale" variable was reassigned a value of "false" on line 3, so nothing printed in the console because the if condition was not met. */
