/* Datatypes are the classifications given to different kinds of data. THe seven fundamental datatypes used in JavaScript are: numbers, strings, booleans, null, undefined, symbols, and objects. The first six datatypes are referred to as "primitive" because they are the most basic. Objects are more complex. Lines 1 and 3 print a strings to the console, which is just a combination of letters and numbers housed within single or double quotes. While lines 2 and 4 print numbers to the console and they do not require quotations. */
