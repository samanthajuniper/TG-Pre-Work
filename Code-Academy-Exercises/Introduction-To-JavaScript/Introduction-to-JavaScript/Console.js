console.log(22);
console.log(20);

/*The console is panel that displays messages, such as errors, to developers. I can log to my console to see drect outputs of my code. In Java Script "console' is a keyword, which JavScript recognizes and treat specially because it is built into it. Console is also an object that has actions built into it, like the ".log()" function. On lines 1 & 2 I used the "console.log()" to print the numbers "22" and "20" in the console. Becuase I am not currently linked to an html document, my code goes no where and my text-editor sends me an error. */
