/* Methods are actions you can perform in JavaScript. I can call, or use, a method by appending an instance to a dot operator, the name of the method, and a pair of parentheses. The method on line 3 returns "CODECADEMY" to the console, and the method on line 6 returns "Remove whitespace" to the console. */
