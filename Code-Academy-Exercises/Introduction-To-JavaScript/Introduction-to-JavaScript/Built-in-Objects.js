/*Another built-in-object in JavaScript is the Math object. It can be used with a variety of methods to do different things. On line 1 the "Math.random()" method generates a random number between 1 and 0. By multiplying this method by 5o, it generates a random number between 1 and 50. The "Math.floor()" mehtod is also used in this line to round random numbers to the nearest whole integer. The results of these methods is printed to the console.*/

/*Line two uses the method "Math.ceil()" to returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to the decimal number 53.8. The results are logged to the console. */

/*Line 3 uses the method "Number.isInteger()" to check if the entered number is an integer, and then it prints the boolean "true" in the console for this example. */
