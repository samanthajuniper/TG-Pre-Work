#On line 2 I installed the Babel command line package and added it to the "devDependencies" property in the "package.json" file. Then on line 3 I installed the Babel preset environment package and add it to the "devDependencies" property in the "package.json" file. When I typed "ls" after these commands I could see the Babel packages and all their dependencies in the "node_modules" folder.
