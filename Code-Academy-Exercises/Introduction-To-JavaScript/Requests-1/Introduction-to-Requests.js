/* There are many types of HTTP requests. The four most commonly used types of HTTP requests are GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. A get request involves retrieving, or getting, information from a source (usually a website). A post request involves posting information to a source that will process the information and send it back. When I pushed the button the screen, I created a GET request. The information that popped up on the screen was a JSON  (JavaScript Object Notation) file,  which is the format of the data that is sent to me by a PUSH request. */
