/* When programming we need to be as explicit as posxsible in what we're communicating to the computer. Writing functions allows us to abstract away a lot of the details and communicate key concepts more concisely. Higher-order functions accept other functions as arguments and/or return functions as output, which allows us  to build abstractions on other abstractions. This is ideal because sing more abstraction in our code allows us to write more modular code which is easier to read and debug. */
