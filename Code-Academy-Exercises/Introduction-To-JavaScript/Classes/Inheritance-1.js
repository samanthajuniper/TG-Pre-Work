/*Inheritance is a tool used to create a parent class (also known as a superclass) with properties and methods that multiple child classes (also known as subclasses) share. Inheritance can help reduce the amount of code you need to write in situations where different classes are only differentiated by a few properties and methods. Shared properties and methods can be contained within a parent class, and then child classes can contain the separate properties and methods that make it unique. */
